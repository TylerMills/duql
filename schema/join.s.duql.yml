title: DUQL Join Function
description: |
  The join function in DUQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
  It supports different types of joins and allows for complex join conditions.

        title: Join Dataset
        $ref: 'dataset.s.duql.json'
        description: |
          Specifies the dataset to join with. This can be a table name, file path, or a subquery.
          Gotcha: Ensure the joined dataset has a column that can be related to the main dataset.
      where:
        title: Join Condition
        type: string
        description: |
          Defines the join condition. This is typically an equality comparison between columns from both datasets.
          Can use '==' shorthand for equality joins on matching column names.
          Example: "orders.customer_id == customers.id"
          Gotcha: Complex join conditions may impact query performance.
      retain:
        title: Join Type
        type: string
        enum: [inner, left, right, full]
        default: inner
        description: |
          Specifies the type of join to perform:
          - inner: Returns only the matched rows (default)
          - left: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table
          - right: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table
          - full: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table
          Gotcha: Different join types can significantly affect the result set size and query performance.
    required: [dataset, where]
    additionalProperties: false
    description: |
      Defines the join operation. Must include 'dataset' and 'where' properties, and can optionally include 'retain'.
      Gotcha: The order of joins in a query can affect the final result and query performance.
required: [join]

examples:
  - join:
      dataset: customers
      where: orders.customer_id == customers.id

  - join:
