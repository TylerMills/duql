title: DUQL Loop Function
description: |
  The loop function in DUQL is used for iterative processing. It applies a sequence of steps 
  repeatedly to an initial dataset until a termination condition is met, typically when the 
  step function returns an empty table.
  IMPORTANT: This feature is experimental and may be subject to changes in future versions.

    description: |
      An array of steps to be applied iteratively. The loop continues until one of the steps 
      produces an empty result set.
      Gotcha: Ensure that your loop has a termination condition to avoid infinite loops.

examples:
  - loop:
      - filter: remaining_balance > 0
      - generate:
          remaining_balance: remaining_balance - payment_amount
      - append: payments_made

  - loop:
      - join:
          dataset: employees
          where: managers.id == employees.manager_id
      - generate:
          level: level + 1
      - filter: not is_null(manager_id)

  - loop:
      - filter: convergence_delta > 0.001
      - generate:
          new_value: (value + target / value) / 2
          convergence_delta: abs(new_value - value)
          value: new_value
      - take: 1000  # Safety limit to prevent infinite loops

  - loop:
      - filter: unprocessed_items > 0
      - generate:
          batch: take(items, 100)
          processed_items: processed_items + process_batch(batch)
          unprocessed_items: unprocessed_items - 100
      - append: processed_batches
