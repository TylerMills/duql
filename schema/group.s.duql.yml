          Specifies the columns to group by. This can be:
          - A single column name (e.g., "department")
          - An array of column names (e.g., ["year", "month", "category"])
          - 'table.*' to group by all columns of a table
          Gotcha: Grouping by too many columns can lead to performance issues and may not provide meaningful aggregations.
