Certainly! I'll create comprehensive documentation for the DUQL Window Function based on the provided schema. Here's the markdown documentation:

# DUQL Window Function

The window function in DUQL is a powerful tool for performing calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. It allows for complex analytics and comparisons within specified ranges or groups of data.

## Syntax

```yaml
window:
  <window_type>: <value>
  <additional_steps>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `rows` | string or integer | Specifies a range of rows relative to the current row position. |
| `range` | string | Specifies a range of values relative to the current row value. |
| `expanding` | boolean | When true, creates a cumulative window (alias for `rows: ..0`). |
| `rolling` | integer | Specifies a rolling window of n rows, including the current row. |

Additional steps can be included within the window operation, such as `sort`, `select`, or `generate`.

## Window Types

### Row Range

```yaml
window:
  rows: <start>..<end>
```

- Specifies a range of rows relative to the current row position.
- Examples:
  - `"0..2"`: Current row and next two rows
  - `"-2..0"`: Previous two rows and current row
  - `"..0"`: All preceding rows and current row
  - `".."`: All rows in the partition

**Gotcha:** Large row ranges can impact performance on large datasets.

### Value Range

```yaml
window:
  range: <start>..<end>
```

- Specifies a range of values relative to the current row value.
- Example: `"-1000..1000"`: All rows within 1000 units of the current row's value

**Gotcha:** Range is based on the values in the sorted column, not row numbers.

### Expanding Window

```yaml
window:
  expanding: true
```

- Creates a cumulative window (alias for `rows: ..0`).
- Useful for running totals or cumulative aggregations.

**Gotcha:** Can lead to performance issues on very large datasets.

### Rolling Window

```yaml
window:
  rolling: <n>
```

- Specifies a rolling window of n rows, including the current row.
- Example: `7` for a 7-day rolling window.

**Gotcha:** Ensure the window size is appropriate for your data and analysis needs.

## Examples

### Moving Average

```yaml
window:
  rows: "0..2"
  sort: [date, -amount]
  select:
    moving_average: average amount
```

This example calculates a moving average over the current row and the next two rows, sorted by date and amount descending.

### Cumulative Sum

```yaml
window:
  expanding: true
  generate:
    cumulative_sum: sum sales
```

This creates a running total of sales using an expanding window.

### Weekly Average

```yaml
window:
  rolling: 7
  generate:
    weekly_average: average daily_visitors
```

This calculates a 7-day rolling average of daily visitors.

### Centered Median

```yaml
window:
  rows: "-2..2"
  sort: date
  select:
    centered_median: median temperature
```

This computes a centered median temperature using two rows before and after the current row.

### Price Ranking

```yaml
window:
  range: "-1000..1000"
  sort: price
  select:
    price_rank: rank this
```

This ranks prices within a range of 1000 units above and below the current price.

### Percent of Total

```yaml
window:
  rows: ".."
  generate:
    percent_of_total: amount / sum(amount) * 100
```

This calculates each row's percentage of the total amount across all rows.

### Running Total and Rank

```yaml
window:
  rows: "..0"
  sort: date
  generate:
    running_total: sum amount
    rank_by_amount: rank -amount
```

This example computes both a running total and a rank based on amount in descending order.

### Volatility Calculation

```yaml
window:
  rolling: 30
  sort: date
  generate:
    volatility: stddev price / average price
```

This calculates price volatility over a 30-day rolling window.

### Rate of Change

```yaml
window:
  rows: "-1..1"
  sort: timestamp
  generate:
    rate_of_change: (lead(value) - lag(value)) / (2 * interval)
```

This computes the rate of change using the previous and next values.

### Cumulative Conversion Rate

```yaml
window:
  expanding: true
  sort: date
  generate:
    cumulative_conversion_rate: sum(conversions) / sum(visitors) * 100
```

This calculates a cumulative conversion rate over time.

## Best Practices

1. ðŸŽ¯ Choose the appropriate window type for your analysis needs.
2. ðŸ”¢ Be mindful of window sizes, especially on large datasets.
3. ðŸ“Š Use sorting within window functions to ensure consistent results.
4. ðŸš€ Consider performance implications, especially with expanding windows or large ranges.
5. ðŸ§ª Test window functions with sample data to verify results.
6. ðŸ“ˆ Combine window functions with other DUQL operations for complex analyses.

## Related Functions

- [`sort`](sort.md): Often used within window functions to order data.
- [`generate`](generate.md): Used to create new columns based on window calculations.
- [`select`](select.md): Can be used to choose specific window function results.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Window functions can be computationally expensive, especially on large datasets.
- Not all database systems support all types of window functions. Check your target database's capabilities.
- Complex window functions may require careful optimization for performance.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Window functions are powerful tools for time-series analysis, rankings, and running calculations. They allow you to perform complex analytics without the need for self-joins or subqueries. Experiment with different window types and combinations to unlock deeper insights from your data!
