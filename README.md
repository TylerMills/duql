# DUQL
> Dangerously Usable Query Language

## What?
- A YAML-based query language focused on readability
- Compiles to 100% valid SQL & JSON
- [100% open-source](/LICENSE)
- A thin layer on top of the amazing [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) project

## Priorities
1. JSON Schema Definition
2. `duql` Utility
3. VSCode Extension

### Advanced Query

## Why?
- Balanced: 
    - DUQL leverages YAML to strike a delicate balance between readability and verbosity.
- Logical: SQL isn't structured to map well to how humans think about querying and transforming data. 
    - DUQL is piped allowing you to think about transformations as sequential steps with clear "in" and "out".
- The Alternatives: 
    - SQL doesn't map well to how humans think about querying and transforming data
    - JSON is too verbose both when writing and reading
    - ORMs lock you into a specific programming language
    - PRQL queries become harder to read as queries become more complex
- Modern:
    - Queries will increasingly be generated by LLMs, not written; and DUQL is designed to maximize readability.
    - Validating a query and understanding how it works has never been easier.

## Install
> Coming Soon

## Writing / Editing
> [!NOTE]  
> DUQL is 100% valid YAML. As a result, you can leverage all your awesome YAML extensions that exist today.

> [!TIP]  
> The following line will add base validation and hints:
> `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://json.schemastore.org/duql-schema-0.0.0.yml`

## Usage
### Basic
```console
duql -w
```
> [!TIP]  
>  Runs in `watch` mode, generating and updating `.sql` files for `.duql` file changes in current directory.
> Outputs to `duql` subdirectory.

### Advanced
```console
