# DUQL
> Dangerously Usable Query Language

<p align="center"><img src="https://tyler-mills-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/duql-logo.png" width="400"></p>

## What?
- A YAML-based query language
- Compiles to SQL & JSON
- [100% open-source](/LICENSE)
- An abstraction on top of the awesome [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) project
- As a result of being directly serializable to (understandable) JSON, great for building frontend query experiences

## Priorities
1. Definition in JSON Schema & Documentation [In Progress]
2. Validation of translation to PRQL (and as a result SQL)
3. Query Builder POC
4. Tooling, etc.

## Examples
### DUQL vs. SQL

#### SQL

### Advanced Query

## Why?
- Balanced: 
    - DUQL leverages YAML to strike a delicate balance between readability and verbosity.
- Logical: SQL isn't structured to map well to how humans think about querying and transforming data. 
    - DUQL is piped allowing you to think about transformations as sequential steps with clear "in" and "out".
- The Alternatives: 
    - SQL doesn't map well to how humans think about querying and transforming data
    - JSON is too verbose both when writing and reading
    - ORMs lock you into a specific programming language
    - PRQL queries become harder to read as queries become more complex
- Modern:
    - Queries will increasingly be generated by LLMs, not written; and DUQL is designed to maximize readability.
    - Validating a query and understanding how it works has never been easier.

## Install
### macOS
Install via Brew:
```
brew tap theduql/duql
brew install duql
```

### Linux
Run the following command in your terminal: 
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theduql/duql/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Writing / Editing
> [!NOTE]  
> DUQL is 100% valid YAML. As a result, you can leverage all your awesome YAML extensions that exist today.
> We plan to support improved syntax highlighting for expression strings in a custom DUQL IDE extension at some point.

## Usage
> Coming Soon
